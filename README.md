# âœ… What you should do:
- Save this as a **`README.md`** file in your project folder.
- Push it to GitHub when you make your first commit.
- Update the **repo link** (`YOUR-USERNAME/mindful-living-site`) to match your real GitHub repository URL.

# âœ¨ After that:

You and your friend can:

- **Clone and pull** changes easily
- **Push updates** like new pages, animations, features
- Collaborate just like real-world teams ðŸ”¥

# ðŸŽ¯ Bonus:

Want me to also show you:

- How to **setup branch protection** (so no one accidentally breaks the main branch)?
- How to **set up Vercel or Netlify free hosting** so you can **share a live link** while working on it?

Both are super quick if you want! ðŸš€  
Would you want to set up a live demo site too? ðŸŽ¯
